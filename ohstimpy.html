<p id="firedogs">What is this series?</p>
 <p>Ren and Stimpy is a comedy show created by John K. (disowned) for Nickelodeon. It was animated by Spumco (seasons 1-2) and Games Animation (seasons 3-5).</li>
 The show was about the misadventures of a Chihuahua named Ren and a Manx cat named Stimpy, the plot usually revolving around different cliche themes, the duo's money-making schemes, or in random scenarios. The show also had its own parodies of advertisements, appearing before or after episodes. </p>
